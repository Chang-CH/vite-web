# Floyd's cycle detection

Use case: Given a linked list (or stream!), detect if there is a cycle in the list and return the length of the loop.

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(1)

If it is possible to store visited hash map O(n) space, or you can modify the linked list with a visited flag, then those would be a better option out of simplicity.

## Intuition

Floyd's is a 2 pointer algorithm. It uses a slow pointer and a fast pointer. 
The fast pointer moves twice as much as the slow pointer. If a cycle is present, the fast pointer must eventually catch up to the slow pointer.
Furthermore, we are able to determine the length of the loop using some maths:

- suppose the linked list has a cycle of length `m` and a start of length `n`.
- suppose the slow pointer has met the fast pointer after `k` steps, where `k = n + x` for some `x`.
- the fast pointer has moved `2k` steps where `2k = n + x + m`.
- therefore loop length is `k`.
- furthermore, we notice than `m = n + x`. If we move one pointer to the start and move both pointers at the same speed, they will meet at the start of the loop.
- this is because `n + x + n == m + n == n`, the pointer in front would have made exactly 1 loop around the cycle.
