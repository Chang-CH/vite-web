# Knuth Morris Pratt (KMP) + Longest Prefix Suffix (LPS)

Use case: Given a string `s` and a pattern `p`, find all occurrences of `p` in `s`.

- Time Complexity: O(n + m)
- Space Complexity: O(m)

## Knuth Morris Pratt (KMP)

The KMP algorithm relies on the Longest Prefix Suffix array. 
In the LPS array of string `p`, `lps[i]` denotes the the longest prefix of `p` that is also a suffix of `p[:i+1]`.
Using this information, instead of restarting from the start when a mismatch/restart occurs, we can start off at the current index of s, and reset the matched characters to `lps[i]`.

### Example:

```python
s = "aabaabaa"
p = "aabaad"
lps = [0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 0]
```

1. suppose we are at index 5 of s `|aabaa[b]aa`, having matched the 5 initial characters of p `aabaa[d]`.
2. A mismatch occurs: `b != d`, so we must reset.
3. from the lps array, we know that at index 4, the first `lps[4] = 2` characters of p are also a suffix of p: `[aa]b[aa]...`.
4. Therefore, we know that the first 2 characters of p are already matched, and we can compare `p[2]` with `s[5]`: `s = aab|aa[b]aa`, `p = aa[b]aad`.

### Code

```python

def KMP(s, p):
    lps = compute_lps(p)

    s_ptr = 0
    p_ptr = 0

    while s_ptr < len(s):
        if s[s_ptr] == p[p_ptr]:
            s_ptr += 1
            p_ptr += 1

            # check full p matched
            if p_ptr == len(p):
                print("Pattern found at index", s_ptr - p_ptr)
                p_ptr = lps[p_ptr - 1] # continue search for more matches
        else:
            if lps[p_ptr - 1] != 0:
                # suffix found, shift p_ptr to the suffix
                p_ptr = lps[p_ptr - 1]
            else:
                # no matches at all, full reset and move forward
                s_ptr += 1
                p_ptr = 0
```

### Longest Prefix Suffix (LPS)

Now that we know the use case of the LPS array, how do we compute it?

- Time Complexity: O(m)
- Space Complexity: O(m)

## Intuition

Since KMP resets to the LPS value, the suffix cannot be the entire string (it would cause an infinite loop!). Therefore, `lps[0] = 0`.

1. `lps[0] = 0` by definition.
2. Initialise `length = i - 1`.
3. `lps[i] = length + 1` if `p[i] == p[length]`: we can extend the previous prefix/suffix. Increment `length`.
4. mismatch occurs: attempt to recurse: `length = lps[length]`.

## Why the recursion? Why not length -= 1?

1. Consider the case `p = "abacabad"`. lps array is `[0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ?]`.
2. At index 7 (`[aba](c)[aba](d)`), mismatch occurs `c != d`. We cannot simply decrement length by 1, since we need to recheck `[ab]aca[ba]d` for match.
3. How can we avoid repeated computation? Notice that we can use current prefix `aba` to skip some computation: `[a]b[a]`, since `lps[2] = 1`.
4. reset `length = lps[length - 1]`. current state: `[a](b)acab[a](d)`. Continue.
5. if `length == 0`, no prefix/suffix found, set lps to 0 and move forward.

```python
def compute_lps(p):
    lps = [0] * len(p)
    i = 1
    length = 0

    while i < len(p):
        if p[i] == p[length]:
            length += 1
            lps[i] = length
            i += 1
        else:
            if length != 0:
                length = lps[length - 1]
            else:
                lps[i] = 0
                i += 1
    return lps
```
