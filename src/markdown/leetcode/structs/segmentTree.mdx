# Segment Tree

Use case: Range queries, what is the maximum value in range [l, r]? More overhead/ boilerplate than Fenwick Tree, but more flexible (fenwick can only sum/subtract etc., not min/max).

- Time Complexity: O(log n) 
- Space Complexity: O(n)

## Intuition

- suppose we have an array of n size, we wish to do some query of range [l,r]
- we build a tree with n leaf nodes (total 2n nodes). each leaf node has value of the array element at that index.
- each internal node has value of some operation on its children. For example, the sum of its children.
- to query [l,r], we check 3 cases:
    - if the entire range is within the left child `r <= mid`, we recurse on the left child. vice versa for right child `l > mid`.
    - if the range is split between left and right child, we recurse on both children and combine the results.

## Why cant we use fenwick trees?

Fenwick trees rely on the fact that the operation is invertible. 
Suppose we want to query the range `[4, 16]`. fenwick tree computes this by subtracting `[16, n]` from `[4, n]`.
Suppose that the operation is now `max`. Given `max([4, n]) = 10` and `max([16, n]) = 10`, we cannot be sure that `max([4, 16]) = 10`.

## Key points

- segment trees are 0 indexed for queries/updates. 
- for any tree node, its parent is at index i // 2, left child is at index i * 2, right child is at index i * 2 + 1.
- The first leaf node is at index n, and the last leaf node is at index 2n - 1.

```python
class SegmentTree:
    def __init__(self, arr, start = 0, end = len(arr) - 1):
        self.start = start
        self.end = end
        self.mid = (start + end) // 2

        if start == end:
            self.left = None
            self.right = None
            self.val = arr[start]
            return self
        
        self.left = SegmentTree(arr, start, self.mid)
        self.right = SegmentTree(arr, self.mid + 1, end)
        self.val = self.operation(self.left.val, self.right.val)

    
    def operation(self, a, b):
        # Modify this
        return a + b
    
    def update(self, i, val):
        if self.start == self.end and self.start == i:
            self.val = val
            return
        
        if i <= self.mid:
            self.left.update(i, val)
        else:
            self.right.update(i, val)
        self.val = self.operation(self.left.val, self.right.val)

    
    def query(self, l, r):
        if self.start == l and self.end == r:
            return self.val
        
        if r <= self.mid:
            return self.left.query(l, r)
        if l > self.mid:
            return self.right.query(l, r)
        
        return self.operation(self.left.query(l, self.mid), self.right.query(self.mid + 1, r))
