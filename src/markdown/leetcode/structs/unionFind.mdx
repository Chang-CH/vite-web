# Union Find

Use case: given `edges[]`, find out if nodes `a` and `b` are connected. **Highly efficient**, almost linear query time.

- Time Complexity: O(log n) (actually O(alpha(n)), where alpha is the inverse Ackermann function, which is almost linear time)
- Space Complexity: O(n)

## Intuition

We implement two functions:

1. `find`: find the root of the current node.
    - if the current node is the root (i.e. `self.parent == self`), return the current node.
    - otherwise, recuse on the parent.
    - path compression: set the parent of the current node to the root, so that the next time we query the parent, we get the root directly.
2. `union`: connect two nodes.
    - find the root of both nodes using `find()`.
    - if the roots are different, set the parent of one root to the other root.

## Key points

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self):
        self.parent = self

    def find(self):
        if self.parent == self:
            return self
        self.parent = self.parent.find() # path compression, the reason for the inverse ackermann TC
        return self.parent

    def union(self, other):
        root_x = self.find()
        root_y = other.find()

        if root_x != root_y:
            root_x.parent = root_y
```
