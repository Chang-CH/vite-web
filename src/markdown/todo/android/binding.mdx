# Viewbinding vs Databinding

## ViewBinding

automatically creates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module. Suppose we have a layout `my_layout.xml`,
then a binding class `MyLayoutBinding` is created. This class has references to all the views in the layout.

This makes our code much more concise and readable, allowing us to avoid using `findViewById` for each view we want to access.

## DataBinding

Data binding is a superset of view binding. It allows us to bind data to our views directly in the XML file.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<layout xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"
    xmlns:app="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto">
    <data>
        <variable
            name="model"
            type="com.ozaltun.bookstore.model.Book" />
    </data>
</layout>
```

note a few changes:

1. There must be a root `<layout>` tag.
2. We can use `<data>` tag to define variables that we can bind to.

## Comapring the two

Personally, I prefer ViewBinding over DataBinding, for a few reasons:

1. Viewbinding is builds much faster
2. DataBinding adds unnecessary complexity to the view layer, and can make debugging more of a hassle.
