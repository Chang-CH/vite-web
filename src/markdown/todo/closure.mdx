# Why are closures important?

Closures are a powerful concept in programming languages that allow functions to retain access to variables from their parent scope.

They allow us to make function arguments much more concise -- instead of passing in every argument to a function, the function can simply get the values from its parent scope.

Before diving into how it works, let's take a look at what it enables.

```javascript
// currying with closures
function makeAdder(x) {
    return function(y) {
        return x + y;
    };
}

// Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)
const printInaccessibleValue = (value) => {
    return () => console.log(value);
}(123);
printInaccessibleValue(); // 123
console.log(Object.keys(printInaccessibleValue)); // [] we cannot access value
```

## How do closures work?

## Common usages

```javascript
class Factory {
  constructor() {
    this.factoryName = 'ASD';
  }

  getArrow() {
    return () => console.log(this.factoryName);
  }

  getFunc() {
    return function () {
      console.log(this.factoryName);
    };
  }
}
const factory = new Factory();
factory.getArrow()();
factory.getFunc()();
```

## TODO: Memory leaks

- Memory leaks due to closures and usememo: https://www.schiener.io/2024-03-03/react-closures
  - suppose we create a lambda that captures `smallVar`. Further suppose `hugeVar` is also in the same scope.
  - the lambda will capture `smallVar` and `hugeVar` (since it is in the same scope)
  - further suppose we keep we memoize the lambda using `useCallback`.
  - Even after rerender, we are keeping reference to the old hugeVar, which is not garbage collected.
- Why Java closures are not "closures": https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17204279/does-java-8-support-closures
  - capturing contexts mean the jvm cannot just destroy stackframes once it has returned

## TODO: var vs let

```javascript
// see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Closures#creating_closures_in_loops_a_common_mistake
res1 = [];
res2 = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  var text = 'text' + i; // function scoped: same text is shared across all loops. each loop redeclares text (and thats ok)
  let text2 = 'text2' + i; // block scoped: different text2 for each loop
  res.push(function () {
    console.log(text);
  });
  res2.push(function () {
    console.log(text2);
  });
}
for (const func of res) {
  func(); // text9 text9 text9...
}
for (const func of res2) {
  func(); // text0 text1 text2...
}
```
