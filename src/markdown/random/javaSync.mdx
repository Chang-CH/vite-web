## Synchronization in Java

In Java, synchronization is achieved through the `synchronized` keyword. This keyword can be applied to methods or code blocks.

```java
public synchronized void increment() {
    this.count++;
}

public void increment(Object toIncrement) {
    synchronized (toIncrement) {
        toIncrement.count++;
    }
}
```

Each object in Java has an associated monitor. The monitor has several methods, notable ones being:

1. `enter()`: Attempt to acquire the lock. If the lock is already held by another thread, the current thread is blocked, until it is its turn. The same thread can enter a monitor multiple times.
2. `wait()`: Block the current thread until `notify()` or `notifyAll()` is called on the monitor object.
3. `notifyAll()`: Wake up all threads waiting on the monitor object.

When we declare a method as `synchronized`, the compiled code is effectively:

```java
class Example {
    public static synchronized void stincrement() {
        this.count++;
    }

    public synchronized void increment() {
        this.count++;
    }

}

````

```java
class Example {
    public void increment() {
        synchronized (this) {
            this.count++;
        }
    }

    public static void stincrement() {
        synchronized (ClassName.class) {
            this.count++;
        }
    }
}

````

</SideGrid>

What this means is that two distinct static synchronized methods in the same class will block each other, as they are synchronized on the same class object:

```java
public class Example {
    public static int count = 1;

    public static synchronized void stIncrement() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            this.count = this.count + 1;
        }
    }

    public static synchronized void stDouble() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            this.count = this.count * 2;
        }
    }
}

public class Thread1 extends Runnable {
    public void run() {
        Example.stIncrement();
    }
}

public class Thread2 extends Runnable {
    public void run() {
        Example.stDouble();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new Thread1());
        Thread t2 = new Thread(new Thread2());
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        t1.join();
        t2.join();
        System.out.println(Example.count);
    }
}
```

This might not be the desired behaviour, as we might only want to synchronize on the method, and not the class object. To achieve this, we can use a `synchronized` block:

```java
public class Example {
    public static int count = 1;
    private static Object incLock = new Object();
    private static Object doubleLock = new Object();

    public static void stIncrement() {
        synchronized (incLock) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                this.count = this.count + 1;
            }
        }
    }

    public static synchronized void stDouble() {
        synchronized (doubleLock) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
                this.count = this.count * 2;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Now, the two methods will not block each other, as they are synchronized on different objects.
