# Home server full setup


## Services overview

1. Cloudfare proxy
    1. Hides your server's public IP address. Clients connect to Cloudfare proxy, proxy sends request to next layer.
    2. HTTPS termination (optional). Cloudfare can terminate HTTPS connections and send unencrypted traffic to your server.
    3. Bot mitigation + Firewall. Cloudfare can block malicious traffic before it reaches your server. You can also set custom firewall rules (e.g. Captcha challenge all non Singaporean visitors).
    4. DNS/DDNS. Resolves your domain name to your server's IP address. Since cloudfare provides an api to update DNS, we can run a cronjob to update DNS if we do not have a static IP.
2. OPNsense + ProxMox
    1. OPNsense is a firewall/router that sits between your server and the internet. It can monitor and block incoming/outgoing traffic.
    2. ProxMox is a hypervisor that runs OPNsense and your server. Running OPNsense on a VM separates the firewall from the server, isolating compromised services from the firewall in the event of an attack.
3. Nginx
    1. Reverse proxy. Nginx listens on port 80/443 and forwards requests to the appropriate service.
    2. Load balancer. Nginx can distribute incoming requests to multiple servers.
    3. Rate limiting. Nginx can limit the number of requests a client can make in a given time period.
    4. HTTPS termination. Nginx can terminate HTTPS connections and send unencrypted traffic to your server.
4. Docker
    1. Containerization. Docker isolates services from each other, preventing one service from affecting another.
    2. Portability. Docker containers can be easily moved between servers.
    3. Resource management. Docker can limit the amount of CPU/memory a container can use.
    4. Your services will all be running in their own containers.

## Cloudfare

1. [Optional] Transferring domain to Cloudfare
    1. Transfer DNS records to Cloudfare. Clicking add domain in cloudfare should automatically import (most) of your DNS records. At the last step, 2 urls should be shown. Keep these for step 2.
    2. On your existing domain registrar, change the nameservers to custom and paste Cloudfare's nameservers (the 2 links provided at the step above).
    3. Obtain the auth code for domain transfer. In cloudfare, search for domain transfer and enter the auth code.
    4. An email will be sent to your namecheap account email. Use this to expedite the transfer.
2. Setting up DNS
    1. Add a new `A` record with your server's public IP address. You can use [https://whatismyipaddress.com/](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) to find your public IP. If you wish to deploy on root domain, set name as `domain.com`. Otherwise, set name as your subdomain, e.g. `api` for `api.domain.com`.
    2. [Optional] for multiple subdomains routed to the same IP, consider setting up an `A` record with the main subdomain (e.g. `home`). For other subdomains, create `CNAME` records, but instead of setting the ip, set host as `home.domain.com`.
    3. [Optional] turn on cloudfare proxy. This means that when a client accesses your server, the request goes through cloudfare first. This hides your server's public IP address.
3. Set up SSL. Select one of the below options:
    1. Flexible: SSL terminates at the cloudfare proxy. unencrypted HTTP is sent to your server.
    2. Full: enables end to end encryption. Use this if your server does not generate publicly trusted certs.
    3. Full (strict): enables end to end encryption. Use this if your server generates publicly trusted certs. Since Nginx Proxy Manager supports automatically generating lets encrypt certs, this should be the best option.
5. Set up Web Application Firewall (WAF): Go to the firewall tab and enable WAF. Suggested rules include:
    1. Block known bots on subdomains. (Known Bots && URI Path contains \*.domain.com)
    2. JS Challenge non whitelisted request origin countries. (e.g. Country is not Singapore && URI Path contains \*.domain.com)

## Port Forwarding

1. Find the admin IP of your router. for singtel routers, this is usually `192.168.1.254`.
2. Find the port forwarding tab. It should look something like this:
![port forwarding](/markdown/selfhosted/setup/portforward.png)
3. Port forward ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS) to your server's local IP address. You can obtain your ip using `ipconfig` on windows or `ifconfig` on linux. You might also be able to find it in the firewall/DMZ page of your router admin console.
4. Setup DHCP reserved: Since our port forward is configured with our local private ip, we need to ensure DHCP does not assign a new random ip to our server if we restart. Under `Home Network Configuration`, click on settings and scroll down until you reach the `Manual devices Reserve` section:
![dhcp reserve](/markdown/selfhosted/setup/dhcpreserve.png)

## Docker services

Most of the services used are installed as docker containers. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and 
follow the guides below to set up each service.
