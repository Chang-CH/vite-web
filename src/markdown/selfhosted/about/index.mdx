# Home server

<GithubLink link="https://github.com/source-academy/java-slang" />

"Save" on hosting costs with this one simple trick!

## How it works

Say we are accessing `jellyfin.domain.com`. The request goes through the below layers:

1. Cloudfare proxy DNS: resolves the domain to an IP. If we enable cloudfare proxy, this IP is not actually the IP of the server, but cloudfare's proxy IP, a reverse proxy. Also a firewall.
2. Proxmox + OPNsense: firewall/router that sits between the server and the internet. It can monitor and block incoming/outgoing traffic.
4. Nginx: Reverse proxy. Multiple domains can be hosted, and we only need to expose port 443. Nginx then proxies the request to the appropriate port/service.
5. Authentik: SSO authentication.
6. Jellyfin: The actual service we wish to access, living in a docker container.
