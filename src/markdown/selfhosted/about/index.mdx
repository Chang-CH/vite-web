## What is self hosting?

Self hosting refers to hosting services on your own server, rather than using a third party service like Amazon AWS or Google Cloud.
Self hosting can be fairly tedious to set up, but there are several reasons you might want to self host a server:

1. **Privacy**: You have full control over your data. Most free services we use are not free, but rather we pay with our data. See: [De-google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeGoogle)
2. **Cost**: If you have a lot of data, or require a lot of processing power, and have an old laptop lying around, it might be cheaper than a cloud service for the same specs.
3. **Customization**: You are free to customize the server to your needs. Some cloud providers limit or paywall certain features, such as cronjobs.

That said, there are some considerations to keep in mind:

1. **Security**: You are responsible for the security of your server (and everyone else on the same network as your machine!)
2. **Maintenance**: You are responsible for keeping your server up to date, and backing up your data.

## How it works

For how a web service works, there is an excellent article written by mozilla [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Performance/How_browsers_work).
For self hosted services, there are a few main differences:

1. **No static IPs**: Unless you are on a premium internet plan, it is likely that your public IP address changes every now and then. This means you need a dynamic DNS service to constantly update your public IP.
2. **Port forwarding**: By default, most routers block incoming connections. You need to set up port forwarding to allow incoming connections to your server.

## Services

Below is a list of services that I run:

1. Firefly 3: personal finance manager

3. Yacht: container management dashboard
4. N8N: Automation + bot integration
