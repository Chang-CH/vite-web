# What is debounce

Debouncing is a technique used to limit the rate at which a function is called. This is especially useful for functions that are called preemptively, such as searching results on user input.
Note that for situations where throttling is required, debouncing may not be the best solution.

Here is its behaviour:

1. The debounced function is called.
2. A timer starts ticking for `x` amount of time.
3. If the debounced function is called again before the timer is up, the timer is reset.
4. If the timer runs out, the actual function is called.

Notice how the function is only called after no further calls are made for `x` amount of time. For use cases where the goal is to limit the number of calls,
debouncing makes the function feel sluggish, as it only responds after a certain amount of time has passed. Throttling, on the other hand, works as follows:

1. The throttled function is called.
2. The actual function is called.
3. A timer starts ticking for `x` amount of time.
4. If the throttled function is called again before the timer is up, the function is not called.

## Implementing debounce

Let us walk through how we might implement this function.

1. We need to create a function that takes in a function and a delay. Since debounce has a default value, we also provide it.
2. In the event that the debounced function was called before, but the timer is not yet up, we need to cancel its execution.
3. To do this, we use `clearTimeout`, passing in the id of the still running timeout. This id comes from the return value of its `setTimeout`.
4. We then set a new timeout, which will call the actual function after the delay.

```javascript
function debouncer(fn, delay = 500) {
  let timer;
  return function (...args) {
    clearTimeout(timer);
    timer = setTimeout(() => {
      fn(...args);
    }, delay);
  };
}

const debounced = debouncer(text => console.log(text));
debounced(1); // (no output)
debounced(2); // (2)
setTimeout(() => debounced(3), 1000); // 3 after 1.5s
```

### Implementing throttle

What about `throttle`? let's take a crack at it.

```javascript
function throttler(fn, delay = 500) {
  let isRunning = false;
  return function (...args) {
    if (!isRunning) {
      fn(...args);
      isRunning = true;
      setTimeout(() => {
        isRunning = false;
      }, delay);
    }
  };
}

const throttled = throttler(text => console.log(text));
throttled(1); // 1
throttled(2); // (no output)
setTimeout(() => throttled(3), 1000); // 3 after 1s
```
