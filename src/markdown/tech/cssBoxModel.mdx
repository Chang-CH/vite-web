# CSS Box model

An element's actual width is calculated as `width + padding + border`. The same goes for the height. The `margin` is not included in the calculation.

This means that if we have a div with `width: 100%`, adding padding will cause it to overflow its parent element.

```css
.parent {
  width: 100vw;
}

.child {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

To fix this, we use `box-sizing: border-box`. This changes the calculated width to include padding and border.

```css
.parent {
  width: 100vw;
}

.child {
  width: 100%;
  padding: 10px;
  border: 1px solid black;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
