## Synchronization in Java

In Java, synchronization is achieved through the `synchronized` keyword. This keyword can be applied to methods or code blocks.

```java
public synchronized void increment() {
    this.count++;
}

public void increment(Object toIncrement) {
    synchronized (toIncrement) {
        toIncrement.count++;
    }
}
```

Each object in Java has an associated monitor. The monitor has several methods, notable ones being:

1. `enter()`: Attempt to acquire the lock. If the lock is already held by another thread, the current thread is blocked, until it is its turn. The same thread can enter a monitor multiple times.
2. `wait()`: Block the current thread until `notify()` or `notifyAll()` is called on the monitor object.
3. `notifyAll()`: Wake up all threads waiting on the monitor object.

When we declare a method as `synchronized`, the compiled code is effectively:

<SideGrid>
```java
class Example {
    public static synchronized void stincrement() {
        this.count++;
    }

    public synchronized void increment() {
        this.count++;
    }

}

````

```java
class Example {
    public void increment() {
        synchronized (this) {
            this.count++;
        }
    }

    public static void stincrement() {
        synchronized (ClassName.class) {
            this.count++;
        }
    }
}

```

</SideGrid>

What this means is that two distinct static synchronized methods in the same class will block each other, as they are synchronized on the same class object:

```java
public class Example {
    public static int count = 1;

    public static synchronized void stIncrement() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            Example.count = Example.count + 1;
            System.out.println("Thread # " + Thread.currentThread().getId() + ": " + Example.count);
        }
    }

    public static synchronized void stDouble() {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            Example.count = Example.count * 2;
            System.out.println("Thread # " + Thread.currentThread().getId() + ": " + Example.count);
        }
    }
}


class Thread1 implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        Example.stIncrement();
    }
}

class Thread2 implements Runnable {
    @Override
    public void run() {
        Example.stDouble();
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new Thread1());
        Thread t2 = new Thread(new Thread2());
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
        try {
            t1.join();
            t2.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        System.out.println(Example.count);
    }
}
```

output:

```
Thread # 1: 2
Thread # 1: 3
Thread # 1: 4
Thread # 1: 5
Thread # 1: 6
Thread # 2: 12
Thread # 2: 24
Thread # 2: 48
Thread # 2: 96
Thread # 2: 192
```

Notice how `stDouble` has to wait to acquire the monitor Thread 1 has entered before it can start. This might not be the desired behaviour, as we might only want to synchronize on the method, and not the class object. To achieve this, we can use a `synchronized` block:

```java
public class Example {
    public static int count = 1;
    private static Object incLock = new Object();
    private static Object doubleLock = new Object();

    public static void stIncrement() {
        synchronized (incLock) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                Example.count = Example.count + 1;
                System.out.println("Thread # " + Thread.currentThread().getId() + ": " + Example.count);
            }
        }
    }

    public static void stDouble() {
        synchronized (doubleLock) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                Example.count = Example.count * 2;
                System.out.println("Thread # " + Thread.currentThread().getId() + ": " + Example.count);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```
Thread # 30: 4
Thread # 29: 4
Thread # 29: 8
Thread # 30: 8
Thread # 30: 16
Thread # 29: 16
Thread # 30: 34
Thread # 29: 34
Thread # 30: 68
Thread # 29: 68
```

Now, the two methods will not block each other, as they are synchronized on different objects.
