# Prototypical Inheritance in JavaScript

You might have heard of prototypical inheritance in JavaScript, but what exactly is it?
How does it differ from classical inheritance?

## Inheritance and Polymorphism: the basics

Suppose we wish to model `Cat` and `Dog` classes.

Both cats and dogs are animals, which `eat`. A `Cat` can also `meow`, while a `Dog` can `bark`. At the same time, all animals have an age.

```java
class Animal {
    public int age;

    public Animal(int age) {
        this.age = age;
    }

    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("Nom Nom");
    }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
    public void meow() {
        System.out.println("Meow");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    public void bark() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}
```

Further suppose we wish to model a `Kitten` class, which is a `Cat` but sounds a little different when it `meow`s.

```java
class Kitten extends Cat {
    @Override
    public void meow() {
        System.out.println("Mew");
    }
}
```

When we call the `kitten.meow()`, `"Mew"` will be printed, whereas `kitten.eat()` will print `"Nom Nom"`.
What we are seeing in action are two things: **inheritance** and **polymorphism**. **Inheritance** models the _IS-A_ relationship between
`Cat` and `Animal` -- a `Cat` is an `Animal`, and as all animals eat, so can a cat.

**Polymorphism** enables us to override the way a `Kitten` meows. A `Kitten` is a `Cat`, but it meows differently.

## Prototypical Inheritance in JavaScript

For those only familiar with ES6 JavaScript, classical inheritance seems familiar. Let us make something similar in JavaScript:

```js
class Animal {
  constructor(age) {
    this.age = age;
  }

  eat() {
    console.log('Nom Nom');
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  meow() {
    console.log('Meow');
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  bark() {
    console.log('Bark');
  }
}

class Kitten extends Cat {
  meow() {
    console.log('Mew');
  }
}
```

This, however, is synctactic sugar for pre ES6 function constructors ([not exactly](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36419713/are-es6-classes-just-syntactic-sugar-for-the-prototypal-pattern-in-javascript) but for the most part):

```js
function Animal(age) {
  this.age = age;
}

Animal.prototype.eat = function () {
  console.log('Nom Nom');
};

function Cat(age) {
  Animal.call(this, age);
}

Cat.prototype = new Animal();
Cat.prototype.meow = function () {
  console.log('Meow');
};

function Kitten(age) {
  Cat.call(this, age);
}
Kitten.prototype = new Cat();
Kitten.prototype.meow = function () {
  console.log('Mew');
};
```

## Under the hood: Method lookup

Suppose we call `kitten.meow()`. How do the different languages determine which implementation to call?

### Java

1. Search the class `Kitten` for the method `meow()`.
2. Search for the method recursively in the superclasses `Cat` (excluding parent interfaces).
3. Search for the method in the superinterfaces of `Cat`, searching in parent interfaces if necessary.

### JavaScript

1. Search the object `kitten` for the method `meow()`.
2. Search the prototype of `kitten` for the method `meow()` recursively.

## Comparing the differences

Prototype objects are directly involved when creating a subclass.
In Java, `Class` objects representing the class of an object only serve as metadata.
Modifying the `Class` object will not change instances' behaviour.

```js
Kitten.prototype.meow = function () {
  console.log('Mew');
};
var kitten = new Kitten(1);
kitten.meow(); // Mew
Object.setPrototypeOf(kitten, Dog.prototype);
kitten.bark(); // Bark
```

At the same time, because the prototype itself is an object,
during the creation of `Kitten` we need to create an instance of `Cat` to set as the prototype.

```js
Kitten.prototype = new Cat();
```

Calling superclass methods is also quite different. In Java, we use the `super` keyword, whereas in JavaScript it depends:

```js
function Kitten(age) {
  Cat.call(this, age); // constructor super(), with context bound to this
}

Kitten.prototype.parentMeow = function () {
  Object.getPrototypeOf(Kitten.prototype).meow.call(this);
};
```

Note we have to call the parent method `meow` using `meow.call(this)` to ensure the correct context otherwise `this` will refer to the parent object.

## Are ES6 classes actually just synctactic sugar?

Yes and no. The underlying mechanism is still prototypical inheritance.

1. ES6 class prototypes are read only
2. ES6 classes are not hoisted
   ```js
   console.log(Thing); //Uncaught ReferenceError: Thing is not defined
   class Thing {}
   ```
3. Class declarations and methods are always executed in strict mode

There are many more differences -- see [link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36419713/are-es6-classes-just-syntactic-sugar-for-the-prototypal-pattern-in-javascript).
However, the underlying mechanism is still prototypical inheritance.
