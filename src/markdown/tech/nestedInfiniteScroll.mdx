# Infinite scrolling in a viewpager2

Recently I had to implement a feature involving some legacy code. This screen had a viewpager2,
with each page having an infinite scrolling recyclerviews of height `wrap_content`.
Each recyclerview also had nested scrolling disabled, since scroll events were not properly intercepted.
This meant that each fragment in the viewpager had potentially different heights, which could change at runtime (not predetermined).

## Problem #1: differing heights

`viewpager2`, as it turns out, does not ([and will not](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/133135685)) support differing height children.

This is because under the hood, `viewpager2` uses a recyclerview, which does not trigger a layout recalculation when switching between tabs.

### Existing solution

The existing solution in my team's repository was the obvious low handing fruit -- whenever the fragment's height changes, update the viewpager's height.
Whenever a new page is selected, get the new page's height and update the viewpager's height.

To change the height on page select, a listener was added to the viewpager:

```kotlin
binding.vpMain.registerOnPageChangeCallback(object: OnPageChangeCallback() {
    override fun onPageSelected(position: Int) {
        super.onPageSelected(position)
        val view = getViewAtPosition(position)
        val container = view.getParentContainer()
        // ... calculate layoutparams and update viewpager height if different
    }
})
```

Each fragment implemented a `getParentContainer(): View` method that returned the root view in the fragment. The callback obtains the root view via this
method and calculates the new height based on the root view's height.

To change the height of the viewpager when the child fragment's height changes, a callback was passed to each fragment:

```kotlin
fun fetchMoreData() {
    repository.fetchMoreData {
        rvAdapter.submitList(it)
        adjustHeight(500L)
    }
}

fun adjustHeight(delay: Long = 0L) {
    cancelRenderJob()
    runBlocking {
        delay(delay)
        onRenderFinish?.invoke()
    }
}
```

`onRenderFinish` is a callback passed from the parent fragmetn that sets the viewpager's height to that of the child. Since the child's height has not been changed
when the data is first added, a delay had to be set before the viewpager height could be recalculated.

### Problems with the existing solution

There were plenty of issues with this solution:

1. Every UI change in each fragment that could affect height needs to remember to call `adjustHeight`. List updates, error views, **EVERYTHING**.
2. If the `adjustHeight` delay was shorter than the time it took to render the new data, the pager would seem unresponsive, as the viewpager height would be shorter than the content, making scrolling impossible.
3. If the `adjustHeight` delay was longer than the rerender, the viewpager would recalculate height wrongly, leading to content getting clipped until the next `adjustHeight`.

## Solution 1: re-layout on resume

The first solution is to have the viewpager set to a height of `wrap_content` and then have each fragment re-layout itself on resume.

```kotlin
override fun onResume() {
    super.onResume()
    binding.root.requestLayout()
}
```

This simple solution kind of works, as we can see below:

![viewpager2 somewhat fixed](/markdown/tech/viewPagerDiffFix1.mp4)

There are some issues, though: while we are swiping, the viewpager height is not updated.
We see the new fragment clipped to the height of the previous fragment for a split second.

## Solution 2: intercepting scroll events

The second solution to have all fragments be the same height, and intercept scroll events properly so we do not need
`nestedScrollingEnabled = false`.

```java
class CustomNestedScrollView @JvmOverloads constructor(
  context: Context,
  attrs: AttributeSet? = null,
  defStyleAttr: Int = 0
) : NestedScrollView(context, attrs, defStyleAttr) {

  private var canScrollUp = true
  private var canScrollDown = true
  private var oldY = 0.0f
  private val velocityTracker = VelocityTracker.obtain()

  init {
    // overscroll causes parent to overscroll instead of passing scroll event to child
    overScrollMode = OVER_SCROLL_NEVER
  }

  override fun onInterceptTouchEvent(ev: MotionEvent): Boolean {
    return when (ev.action) {
      MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN -> {
        // Check if this NestedScrollView can scroll
        canScrollUp = canScrollVertically(-1)
        canScrollDown = canScrollVertically(1)
        oldY = ev.getY()
        parent.requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent(false)
        super.onInterceptTouchEvent(ev)
      }

      MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE -> {
        val delta = ev.getY() - oldY
        if ((delta > 0 && canScrollUp)) {
          super.onInterceptTouchEvent(ev)
        } else if (delta < 0 && canScrollDown) {
          // If this view can still scroll, intercept child events
          true
        } else {
          // Otherwise, allow parent to intercept
          super.onInterceptTouchEvent(ev)
        }
      }

      else -> super.onInterceptTouchEvent(ev)
    }
  }

  override fun onTouchEvent(ev: MotionEvent): Boolean {
    val delta = ev.getY() - oldY
    if (delta > 0 && !canScrollUp) {
      // Let this view scroll up if it can
      parent.requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent(false)
    } else {
      // Prevent the parent from intercepting while this view can still scroll
      parent.requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent(true)
    }
    return super.onTouchEvent(ev)
  }
}
```

This custom `NestedScrollView` prioritises parent scrolling when scrolling down, and child scrolling when scrolling up, giving the appearance of the entire
activity being one long view. It does this by requesting the parent layout to not intercept touch events when scrolling up, and intercepting touch events when scrolling down.

Note that for all nested scrollable views other than the last one, we need to disable overscroll -- this is because overscroll takes priority over
touch intercept, consuming the `ACTION_MOVE` event before the child can intercept it. This is done by setting `overScrollMode = OVER_SCROLL_NEVER`, which we do on init to disable it by default.
