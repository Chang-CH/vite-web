"Save" on hosting costs with this one simple trick!

## Use case

Self hosted services may be ideal for a few reasons:

1. Privacy: some services may deal with sensitive data, such as financial information.
2. Cost: at 32.57 cents/kWh, a pi 5 8GB (idle @ 3W) costs between 2 to 4 SGD per month to run. A digital ocean droplet costs 4 (USD?) a month for 512MB of RAM.
3. Fun: why not.

## Network overview

1. Cloudfare proxy DNS: free DNS with a proxy that hides server ip. Also the cheapest registrar.
2. Gmail SMTP: free email service.
3. ddclient: updates the DNS record with the server's public IP.
4. Nginx: reverse proxy for services.
5. Authentik: SSO authentication.
