# Java Virtual Machine startup

The startup behaviour of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) often differs from one implementation to another. As a result, documentation on what happens under the hood is scarce.

Let's explore how the JVM initializes by running a simple hellow world program:

```java
// HelloWorld.java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```

## The Bootstrap Class Loader

Before we can run the program, we have a few classes to load and initialize. Think the main `Thread` object, or the `ClassLoader` object.

How do we load class files when class loaders are Java objects themselves? Enter the bootstrap class loader.
Also known as the primordial class loader, the bootstrap class loader is a native class loader that is responsible for loading the core Java classes.
Unlike other class loaders, the bootstrap class loader has no parent class loaders.

When a class is requested, a class loader does the following:

1. Pass the request to its parent class loader.
2. If the parent class loader is unable to load the class (or if there is no parent loader), attempt to load the class in its own class path.
3. [Optional] Link the class (verify the binary, resolve symbolic references, etc).
   The JVM may choose to do this step eagerly (at load time), or lazily (when the symbolic reference is used).
   Even if the JVM links eagerly, exceptions during resolution will only be thrown when the symbolic reference is used.

## Initializing the JVM

With the bootstrap class loader in place, we can now initialize the JVM on a native thread. This step is implementation dependent, and might something like this:

1. load essential classes: `Object`, `Class`, `Thread`, `Unsafe`, `System`, etc.
2. Initialize the `ThreadGroup` class, then the `Thread` class by calling their `<clinit>` static initializer.
3. Instantiate the `ThreadGroup` object, then the `Thread` object by calling their `<init>` initializer.
4. Set the `group` field of the thread object to the threadgroup, and the `priority` field.
5. Initialize the `System` class by calling its static method `initializeSystemClass()`. This is separate from its `<clinit>` method. Some tasks this method is responsible for include:
   1. Initializing `System.in`, `System.out`, and `System.err`.
   2. Determining the endianness of the system (via `Unsafe` memory allocation).
   3. Setting various system properties (file encoding, line separators, user directories).
6. Initialize the system class loader by calling the `getSystemClassLoader()` method of the `ClassLoader` class.

## Running the Program

With the JVM initialized, we can now run the program. The main class file is loaded with the
system class loader, and the static initializer is run. For some JVM implementations, the JVM might
additionally analyse the class file to identify potential optimizations.
Once the class is ready, the `main` method is invoked.
