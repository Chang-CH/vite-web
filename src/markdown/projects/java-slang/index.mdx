# Source Academy: Java slang JVM

<GithubLink link="https://github.com/source-academy/java-slang" />

The [Source Academy](https://sourceacademy.org) is a learning environment for studying the structure and interpretation of computer programs.
It is used to teach CS1101S programming methodology at the National University of Singapore. Students are taught Source, a sublanguage of JavaScript.

[Java slang](https://github.com/source-academy/java-slang) aims to introduce the Java language into Source Academy, by implementing the necessary components,
such as the compiler and the JVM, in JavaScript.

Each of these components were implemented by individual Final Year Projects at NUS. The JVM was implemented targeting the Java 8 specification, and at the time of writing,
supports threading, synchronization, and dynamic method invocation.
